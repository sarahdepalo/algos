Tackle these independently or together. Attempt to write a solution before you go to Google. If you get frustrated, ask for help! ðŸ˜„

## 01. FizzBuzz

* Write a program that prints out numbers 1 to 100.
* If the number is divisible by 3, the output should be `Fizz`.
* If divisible by 5, the output should be `Buzz`.
* If divisible by both 3 and 5, the output should be `FizzBuzz`.
* Otherwise, the output should just be the number. 

**Example**
```js
// Outputs 1 - 5 
1
2
"Fizz"
4
"Buzz"
```
**Bonus:** How would you edit your function to take in a range of numbers as a parameter? So parameter 16 would only print numbers from 1 - 16?

## 02. Remove Duplicates

* Given an array of integers, remove the duplicates and return an array of only unique elements.

**Example**
```js
const array = [1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 5, 9, 1, 2, 8]
// Expected Return: [1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 8]
```
## 03. Anagram

* An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as elbow and below. Given two strings, check if they are anagrams. Return true if an anagram and false if not.

**Example**
```js
//Input "dog" "god"
true
//Input "cat" "rat" 
false
```

## 04. Capitalization

* Given a phrase, capitalize **every** word.

**Example**
```js
//Input: "hello world"
"Hello World"
```

## 05. Longest Word

* Given a phrase, find the longest word. 

**Example**
```js
//Input: "Find the longest word"
"longest"
```
